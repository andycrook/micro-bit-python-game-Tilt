# micro-bit-python-game-Tilt

The aim of the game is to fill the screen as fast as possible by drawing with a pixel. Once full, the game will report a score to you called 'Delay', based on how long it took to win the game. Press reset to restart the game and go back to a single pixel, and B to start the game. B enables drawing mode and starts counting the delay. Holding A while starting the game enables easy mode.

Hope this is of use!
